The Requirements to the structure

The non holonomic robot(gazebo) should be working as following below,

1.Move randomly in the environment , by choosing 1 out of 6 possible target positions:[(4, 3);(4,2);(4,7);(5, 7);(5, 3);(5,1)], implementing a random position service as in the assignment 1
2.Directly ask the user for the next target position (checking that the position is one of the possible six ) and reach it
3.Start following the external walls
4.Stop in the last position

0. `/Controller` node calls for `/random_target` in order to get random target position among [(-4,-3),(-4,2),(-4,7),(5,-7),(5,-3),(5,1)], and publishes the target position for `/move_base`. After that, the robot starts to move for target.

1.When the robot arrives the target, node calls for `/final_user_req`. Next, `/ask_user_interface` node asks the request on command line. and check if the request position is feasible(among [(-4,-3),(-4,2),(-4,7),(5,-7),(5,-3),(5,1)]) or not. And if it is ok, updates the target position and publishes the target position for `/move_base`. (If it's not feasible target, `/final_user_interface` asks again) After that, the robot starts to move for target same as state 0.

2.When the robot arrives the target,  node calls for `wall_follower`. and after the robot run around the map, it switches to state3.

3.When the robot arrives the target `/final_user_req` gave, the robot stops.

Software architecture

The blue part is user interface. By using this module, I can interact with the robot controller by setting some parameters (in this caes, setting the target position).

The red parts are the ones which implements the actulal robot controller. it processes the inputs comming from gazebo(`/odom`,`/scan`)&user interface and it set a resulting linear and angular velocity for the robot(`/cmd_vel`). And  node is managing  current position and target position. In detail, the robot gets the map by using SLAM and plans the path from the current position to the target position by grobal Path planning(dijkstra) and the robot is moving while avoiding obstacles by using local path planning.

All the green components represent the section of the system which simulate the robot and its physical interaction with the environment.
The simulation is done in following steps:

1.For the first step, final_user_req.py node requests my_srv for a random target position between the range of 1 to 6.Then,the main node publishes the target positions to /move_base/goal and check thes the status of goal by subscribing to the topic /move_base/status.When the robot reaches the target and the status of robot is displayed, the main node requests the user to input again.

2.For the second step, the user chooses one out of six possible target positions and publishes it to /move_base/goal.

3.For the third step,the wall_follower service is generated through initialization of a service client to allow the robot to follow the external walls.

In steps 3 and 4,The interface also allows the user to enter the same or different request at any point in this state.

System’s limitations and possible improvements

Possiblity of changing path on the way

In this system,the robot is moving for target while creating the map by SLAM algorithm, so the path created when the robot is in the initial position is not always optimal path because there is a possibility the robot doesn't notice obstacles. So the robot sometimes changes path, in some case it contributes to detour. And the point is that we already know how the map is. That's why I think I can improve creating optimal path by using amcl which estimate the current position by pattern matching with pre-existing maps and lasar data.
